# ELSC
This project designed to predict values according to iron concentration.
THe projects contains the next files:
1. main.py: this file contains the main program. reads the data, predict R1 according to iron concentration, alongside lipid amount. 
2. figuers: contains figures of the data as measured. Also contains figures of prediction.
In this folder can be found comparison between the predicted values and the measured valuse.

close deadline missions :
1. interaction between iron and lipid 
2. conclude the best model 
3. lipid type as predictor
